# Covid-19 Vaccine Sentiment Analysis using Python

## Introduction
The Covid-19 epidemic has changed the lives of people around the world. But the emergence of its vaccine has led to positive and negative reactions all over the world. In this data science project, we aim to analyze tweets recorded about the Covid-19 vaccine to analyze the sentiments of people for the vaccine.

## Data Collection
The dataset for the sentiment analysis task of the Covid-19 vaccine was collected from Twitter. Twitter is a microblogging and social networking platform where users post and interact with messages called “tweets”. With more than 166 million daily users, Twitter is a valuable data source for any social media discussion related to national and global events.

## Sentiment Analysis using VADER
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically tuned to sentiments expressed in social media. We'll use VADER to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets and obtain sentiment scores for each tweet.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of sentiments in the dataset. Visualization techniques such as kernel density estimation plots and cumulative distribution functions will be used to analyze the sentiments.

## Top Words in Most Positive and Negative Tweets
We'll identify the most positive and negative tweets based on sentiment scores and extract the top words used in these tweets. Word cloud visualizations will be used to display the common words in the most positive and negative tweets.

## Correlation Analysis
We'll explore the correlation between tweet sentiments and other numeric features in the dataset, such as user followers, friends, favorites, and verification status.

## Conclusion
This data science project will provide insights into people's sentiments towards the Covid-19 vaccine on Twitter. The code and analysis can be used to understand how social media discussions reflect public opinions about the vaccine.
